# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in different programming languages. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design and development.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help to make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

- **Factory Method:** Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition or in other words, they help in creating relationships between objects. They also ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do so.

- **Adapter:** Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator:** Adds new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. They define the manner in which classes interact and distribute responsibilities among them.

- **Observer:** Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
